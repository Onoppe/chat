== Welcome

This is a one day project that I created for fun to test realtime chat ability between iphone and web. This project is created using Ruby on Rails with juggernaut and AsyncSocket(iPhone socket wrapper).

I hacked juggernaut to make it to be able to send one line string in non-json format. The modified juggernaut gem is in "mod-juggernaut" folder while the iphone client is in the 'iphone-client' folder.

== Backend

For this application, there is juggernaut backend server running to channel messages between the iPhone client and the web client. The web client is created using Ruby on Rails.

Posting a message from the iPhone: the iPhone client will send a POST request to the RoR instance. Then, RoR will redirect the message back to the juggernaut backend to dispatch the message to both the iPhone client and the web client.

Posting a message from the Web: the Web client will send a Post request to the RoR instance. Blar blar blar. (Refer back to previous paragraph)

== Scalibility

Do you expect a 4 hours hack to scale? And, forget about premature optimization. No one will use your app.
